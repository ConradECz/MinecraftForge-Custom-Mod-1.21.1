Minecraft modding in Java works by extending the gameâ€™s base code through modding with the Forge API and framework, allowing to extend Minecraft's base code. Minecraft version 1.21.1 is what I will specifically be using to create
and test my modpack. By using the Temurin JDK, the build system Gradle, and ParchmentMC to make Minecraft's code readable and well-documented, the development workspace is done within IntelliJ IDEA.

*So far with this modpack I have:*

-Added Custom Items and Textures (9/9/25)

-Added Custom Blocks and Textures with Sound Effects from Minecraft (9/9/25)

-Added Custom Creative Mode Tabs to Organize My Items and Blocks from Minecrafts' (9/10/25)

**Will continue to update the modpack over time including the README**
